This is a small program I created to practice using [QTools](https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools) and creating GUI programs with Common Lisp.

It's not very useful, but interactively draws "[hypocycloid](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypocycloid.html)" and "[epitrochoid](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Epitrochoid.html)" curves, similar to a [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) toy.
